🚀 Getting Started
1️⃣ Clone the repo
2️⃣ Install dependencies:
pip install streamlit pywhatkit
3️⃣ Run the app:
streamlit run app.py
4️⃣ Keep your WhatsApp Web logged in and browser open while sending.

⚠️ Limitations
📝 Note:
Due to WhatsApp’s security policies:
Sending is handled through WhatsApp Web, so you’ll see your browser open a new tab.
You may need to confirm the send for security.
Scheduling works for text messages only (pywhatkit does not support scheduled images natively).
